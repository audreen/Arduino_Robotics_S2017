Analog Input Homework Assignment

For this project I had difficulties with just about everything. I am unable to complete the homework due to the LDR not working and I am not sure why. From this project I have learned that when connected to the 5V on the arduino it goes on the positive side of the breadboard and the GND goes on the negative. I also learned that the A0 chord, LDR, and resistor all have to be on the same row. 
When I first started this I had difficulties putting everything together because I didn't understand where anything went. Because I cannot get this part of the homework to work I do not believe I am able to continue and will have to ask for help tomorrow.
